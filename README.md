### In a nutshell: 
> A private and exclusive social photo sharing app that allows users to share existing quotable images and QOTD snippets to any social media network they'd like.

### User Story
* As a user I expect to be greated with a starter page where I can press play to begin the game
* As a user I expect that when the game is started, I will see images/colors flash on the screen in a sequence or randomly
* I expect as a user to be able to click on the tiles to replicate the sequence I just saw previously. By clicking each tile, I will reveal the correct image to ensure I am replicating the sequence correctly.
* As a user I expect that if I click the tiles in the right sequence, I will advance to another level
* As a user I expect that when I win the game, I can play again or choose to quit the game.
* I expect that as a user, if I did not win, I can either play the game again, or quit entirely.

## In a nutshell: 
> A private and exclusive social photo sharing app that allows designers and design lovers to share existing quotable images and QOTD snippets to any social media network they'd like. The hub is a supplement to an existing website, geared at creating community around similar interests: design and social connection. Aim of the app is to help users promote the site by sharing images that should include a link back to the private hub so others can sign up too.

## User Story
* As a user I expect to be greated with a homepage where I can choose to signup or login to an existing account
* As a user I expect that when I click login I am taken to the main hub page containing the qotd and images to share immediately
* As a user I expect that by signing up I can login in the future, I also will be immediately redirected to the main hub of content
* As a user I expect that if I am logged in I will be able to logout when I am ready to leave.

## Aim of the Application
Allows designers and lovers of design to share inspirational quotes and tips imagery with their fave social network while also getting a dose of inspiration from the daily Qoute of The Day that's shared in the private area.
